## About

DDR Health & Fitness is the personal training practice of David D. Rogers, based in Nashville, TN with online coaching available nationwide. David holds a BS in Exercise Science, AFAA personal trainer certification, and CETI cancer exercise specialist certification. He has 25+ years in the health and wellness industry, is a 2x Ironman finisher, 100-mile ultra marathon finisher, Senior Olympics competitor and national qualifier, and sub-masters powerlifting mid-regional champion.
